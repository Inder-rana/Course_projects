### Steps I have taken to complete this project:
**Github file name:** `Real_estate_insights`

**1.** I started with analyzing the raw data of the real estate company on sheet name `Real estate dataset`, just to get the feel for the data and its properieties, it consist of 2 tables product, customer and their relvant column.

**2.** After I went through the raw data, in the next sheet name `Gender` I have created frequenecy distrubtion table of Male, Female and Firms. Along with a pie chart to respresent their respective frequency, I have also inculded Firms, Firms have no gender. However, I need to add them to this pie chart, as otherwise, we will get a wrong interpretation of the data.

3. I have created another sheet name `Location` with frequenecy distrubtion table and bar chart with Pareto diagram of different locations in the US and abroad, from the chart For example, California, Nevada, and Oregon together, account for 81% of all purchases.
