# Real Estate Insights (Statistics): Project Overview
### [Excel | Statistics]
* Created Frequency distribution tables and charts by applying statistical methods, after analyzing the dataset of a Real Estate company based in the US.
* Insights that I have got after analysis, can help this company run a successful marketing campaign. The marketing team can use these insights to improve their marketing results, target the right audience, and save time and resources for the firm.

### Steps I have taken to complete this project:
**Github file name:** `Real_estate_insights`

**1.** I started with analyzing the raw data of the real estate company on the sheet named `Real estate dataset`, just to get a feel for the data and its proprieties, it consists of 2 tables product, customer, and their relevant columns.

**2.** After I went through the raw data, in the next sheet name `Gender` I created a frequency distribution table of Male, Female, and Firms. Along with a pie chart to represent their respective frequency, I have also included Firms, Firms have no gender. However, I need to add them to this pie chart, as otherwise, we will get a wrong interpretation of the data.

**3.** I have created another sheet name `Location` with a frequency distribution table and a bar chart with a Pareto diagram of different locations in the US and abroad, from the chart For example, California, Nevada, and Oregon together, account for 81% of all purchases.

**4.** Next sheet named `Age` In this sheet I have created an Age-frequency table with a histogram and cumulative frequency line on top of the histogram, also calculated the mean, median, mode, skew, variance, and standard deviation of the age.

**5.** Then I created a scatter plot to show the relationship between Age and Price and also calculated the covariance and correlation coefficient.

**6.** I also created another scatter plot to show the relationship between the price and size of the property.

### Conclusion:

1. Males are more likely to sign contracts and are potentially a better audience for the ads.
2. 68% of the sales came from California, with Nevada, Oregon, Arizona, and Colorado forming 93% of the US customer base.
3. 71% of the sales were made with customers aged between 26 and 55 years old, with a mean age of 46 years, and a standard deviation of 13 years. Younger people buy more property than older people.
4. There is no relationship between the age of a given customer and the price they are willing to pay, and lastly, house prices were highly based on the size of the property.
